/**
 * Email main tabs are SDK instances (`openMainTab({ instanceId })`), so the host saves and restores each tab's
 * state on its own. The store holds one live mailbox, and it always belongs to the focused tab, the Email tab the
 * user was last on. Every other tab keeps its selection and history here and gets them back when it becomes the
 * active tab again. A tab opened without an instance (an older workspace, or a plain `tab:create`) is keyed ''.
 *
 * The current draft belongs to the one tab that showed it: it moves to the focused tab when that tab opens compose, and is
 * released when that tab leaves compose (Save draft, Discard, Send, Close, opening mail), in the same turn as that action,
 * also while a tab switch or restore is running. Only that tab shows it again after a tab switch, a reload, a restart or
 * reopening the tab; a released draft stays closed until Compose or its Drafts entry opens it. Closing the tab releases the
 * saved record at once; reopening the closed tab in the same session takes the draft back.
